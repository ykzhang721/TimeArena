## TimeArena

TimeArena is a dynamic and interactive environment that integrates time to enable human-like efficient multitasking, which challenges agents to handle multiple tasks and parallel processing to save time.

It grounds to 30 real-world tasks in cooking, household activities, and laboratory work.

More details are in the paper.

## Setup Environment

Create a conda environment and install dependency:
```bash
conda create -n timearena python=3.11
conda activate timearena
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running


### Evaluating LLMs
#### For Closed Source Models
If you want to evaluate GPT or Gemini, please enter the corresponding API_KEY.

```bash
# if you want to use openai's model
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
# if you want to use google's model
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_KEY
```

Running ``test.sh`` lets agents to interact with TimeArena and saves the interaction trajectory.
```bash
# household1 refers to the first task of the household activity scenario).
list=("household1"
"household2"
"household3"
"household4"
"household5"
"household6"
"household7"
"household8"
"household9"
"household10")
for item in "${list[@]}"
do
    python LLM_test.py --taskName $item --lm gpt3.5 --total_time 40 --save_path ./trajectory/single --save_name $item
done
```

Required argumentsï¼š

1. `--taskName` refers to the tasks you want to evaluate. If you want to combine tasks, please separate the two task names with a comma. Eg, "cooking1,cooking2"
2. `--lm` refers to the language models you want to evaluate
3. `--total_time` refers to the maximum time for completing a task. For one task, 40 is enough. If there are n task combinations, it is recommended to set it to n*40 (consistent with the setting in the paper)
4. `--save_path` refers to the folder where the generated output will be stored
5. `--save_name` refers to the file name of the generated output

Optional arguments
1. `--constraint` refers to apply resource constraints. (In cooking scenario, we limit the number of pot, fryer and oven to at most one).
2. `--prompting` refers to prompting method, including 'react', 'reflexion' and 'selfplan'.


#### For Open Source Models
For open source models, deploy the model as an API using <a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/">vLLM</a>

For example:
```bash
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model facebook/opt-125m --port 8001
```

Then, running ``test.sh`` lets agents to interact with TimeArena and saves the interaction trajectory.
```bash
# household1 refers to the first task of the household activity scenario).
list=("household1"
"household2"
"household3"
"household4"
"household5"
"household6"
"household7"
"household8"
"household9"
"household10")
for item in "${list[@]}"
do
    python LLM_test.py --taskName $item --lm mistral --total_time 40 --save_path ./trajectory/single --save_name $item --model_name ../hf_model/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 --ip http://localhost --port 8090
done
```

1. `--taskName` refers to the tasks you want to evaluate. If you want to combine tasks, please separate the two task names with a comma. Eg, "cooking1,cooking2"

4. `--save_path` refers to the folder where the generated output will be stored
5. `--save_name` refers to the file name of the generated output
6. `--model_name` refers to model name for deploying vLLM
7. `--ip` refers to the ip address of the model
8. `--port` refers to the port of the model


Optional arguments
1. `--constraint` refers to apply resource constraints. (In cooking scenario, we limit the number of pot, fryer and oven to at most one)
2. `--prompting` refers to prompting method, including 'react', 'reflexion' and 'selfplan'.



### Calculate Four Metrics
Code for calculate the four metrics in the paper: Average Progress Score (score, AS), Completion Speed (score per minute, CS), Task Completion Rate (%, CR) and Average Completion Time (minutes, CT).

To calculate the metrics:
```bash
cd metrics
bash bash_cal_metric.sh
```

For example:
```bash
# The folder path to calculate the metrics
MY_PATH="../trajectory"

python cal_metric.py --path $MY_PATH
```




### Calculate Oracle Performance

To calculate the oracle performance of tasks, you can execute the following code and input the list of tasks in `bash_cal_oracle.sh`


```bash
cd algorithm
bash bash_cal_oracle.sh
```

For example:
```bash
# List contains a total of ten combined tasks. For example, the first combined task is cooking1 and cooking2 (the first and second tasks of the cooking scenario).
list=('cooking1,cooking2'
'cooking2,cooking3'  
'cooking3,cooking4' 
'cooking4,cooking5' 
'cooking5,cooking6' 
'cooking6,cooking7' 
'cooking7,cooking8' 
'cooking8,cooking9' 
'cooking9,cooking10'
'cooking10,cooking1')

python cal_oracle.py --task "${list[@]}"
```

    abstract = "Despite remarkable advancements in emulating human-like behavior through Large Language Models (LLMs), current textual simulations do not adequately address the notion of time. To this end, we introduce TimeArena, a novel textual simulated environment that incorporates complex temporal dynamics and constraints that better reflect real-life planning scenarios. In TimeArena, agents are asked to complete multiple tasks as soon as possible, allowing for parallel processing to save time. We implement the dependency between actions, the time duration for each action, and the occupancy of the agent and the objects in the environment. TimeArena grounds to 30 real-world tasks in cooking, household activity, and laboratory work. We conduct extensive experiments with various LLMs using TimeArena. Our findings reveal that even the most powerful models, e.g., GPT-4, still lag behind humans in effective multitasking, underscoring the need for enhanced temporal awareness in the development of language agents.",
